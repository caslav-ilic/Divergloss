Running the update-po.sh without arguments will do the following:

  - extract the PO template
  - merge all translations
  - compile translations into MO

Each of this phases can be run separately by giving as argument one of:
extract, merge, compile.

The compiled translations will be put in ../mo subdir, where they will be
picked up automatically on subsequent invocation of dgproc scripts
(this subdir is ignored by version control).

Run periodically to bring updated translations into action, possibly in the
compile-only mode if you do not want to touch template and translations.
